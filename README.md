# GistPad

[![Join space](https://vslscommunitieswebapp.azurewebsites.net/badge/gistpad)](http://vslscommunitieswebapp.azurewebsites.net/join_redirect/gistpad)

GistPad is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to manage [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) entirely within the editor. You can open, create, delete, fork, star and clone gists, and then seamlessly begin editing files as if they were local. It's like your very own developer library for building and referencing code snippets, commonly-used config/scripts, programming-related notes/documentation, and [interactive samples](#playgrounds). Additionally, you can collaborate with your friends and colleagues by "following" them, so that you can access/browse/fork and comment on their gists, without ever leaving Visual Studio Code. When needed, you can export gists to GitHub repositories, CodePen, and other services, so that you can start with simple code samples and then seamlessly grow them over time. 🚀

## Getting Started

1. Install this extension from the marketplace and then reload VS Code

   > **Linux Users**: Ensure you have the `gnome-keyring` and `libsecret` packages installed as well. These will enable GistPad to read/write your GitHub auth token securely.

   > **GitHub Enterprise users**: Set the `gistpad.apiUrl` setting to point at the API URL of your GitHub server instance (e.g. `https://[YOUR_HOST]/api/v3`).

1. Open the `GistPad` tab _(look for the notebook icon in the activity bar)_. From there, you can open a Gist by ID/URL, explore the [`Showcase`](#showcase), or sign-in in with a GitHub token, in order to view/edit/create/delete/fork/clone your own gists. To sign-in, you can generate an auth token by visiting [this page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new), giving the token a name (e.g. `gistpad`), and ensuring to check the `gist` checkbox.

   <img width="300px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/69827991-d56f5580-11ce-11ea-9081-17f27b470fd1.png" />

   > **Git+HTTPS Users**: If you've already signed-in to `github.com` with the `git` CLI, GistPad will attempt to provide "single-sign on", assuming you're using HTTPS-based auth, and your login session includes the `gist` scope _(SSH-based auth isn't supported)_.

1. Create a new gist by clicking the `+` icon in the `Gists` toolbar and specifying the files to seed it with (including support for [directories](#files-and-directories)!). Additionally, you can create gists from local files or snippets, by right-clicking them in the `Explorer` tree, or right-clicking an editor window/tab, and selecting `Copy File to Gist`, `Add Selection to Gist` or `Paste Gist File Contents` ([details](#contributed-commands-editor))

   <img width="250px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/69903980-98819b00-1355-11ea-913b-c51981891bcd.png" />

1. View and reply to comments in a Gist by scrolling to the bottom of a Gist file and interacting with the thread (including embedded code snippets!)

   <img width="450px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/70117955-a9633280-161b-11ea-88a5-ac8a15a3b7a0.png" />

1. Stay up-to-date with your friend's and colleague's Gists by following them via the `GistPad: Follow User` command

   <img width="252" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/69890797-c03e1800-12ef-11ea-85be-7d6fe2c8c7ef.png" />

1. If you're working on a web app, and want to create [runnable code samples](#playgrounds), right-click the `Your Gists` node and select `New Playground` (or `New Secret Playground`. This will provide you with a live dev environment, to experiment with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, that is saved as a shareable gist

## Sorting and Grouping

By default, the `Gists` tree sorts gist by their update-time, which allows you to focus on the most recently used gists. However, if you'd like to sort your gists alphabetically, you can click the sort toggle button on the `Gists` tree's toolbar.

<img width="200px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/75098896-65276480-5570-11ea-9880-a76347a15f73.png" />

Additionally, by default, your gists are displayed as a flat list. However, if you'd like to group them by type, you can click the group toggle button on the `Gists` tree's toolbar.

 <img width="200px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/75098775-3fe62680-556f-11ea-8253-3198b00837e1.png" />

### Gist Types

When grouping is enabled, gists are grouped into the following built-in types:

- **dos** - Gists that are composed of nothing but `.txt`, `.md`/`.markdown` or `.adoc` files
- **notebook** - Gists that are compose of nothing by Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`)
- **playground** - Gists that include either a `playground.json` file and/or an `index.html` file. Read more about playgrounds [here](#interactive-playgrounds).
- **playground-template** - Playgrounds whose `playground.json` file sets the `template` property to `true`. Read more about playground templates [here](#user-templates).
- **tutorial** - Playgrounds whose `playground.json` file specifies a `tutorial` property. Read more about tutorials [here](#tutorials).
- **tour** - Gists that include a `tour.json` file, and were created by exporting a [CodeTour](#codetour).
- **code-snippet** - Gists that don't match any of the above more-specific types.

Additionally, if you want to group gists by your own custom types, then simply add a tag to the end of the gist's description, using the following format: `#tag` (or `#tag-name`). Then, when you enable grouping of gists, your gists will be grouped by both the aforementioned types, as well as your custom tag types. You can identify tag groups by the use of the `#` icon next to them.

<img width="200px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/75264671-9c7e5700-57a4-11ea-9bee-eb61cfb9d2f0.png" />

## Files and Directories

When you create a gist via the `New Gist` (or `New Secret Gist`) command, you can specify a comma-separated list of file names to seed the gist with. Furthermore, you could add `/` to your filenames, in order to add them to a sub-directory within the gist. For example, if you create a new gist, and specify `todos/personal.txt,todos/work.txt,reminders.txt`, the gist will include a `reminders.txt` file at the root of the gist, and `personal.txt` and `reminders.txt` files within a new directory called `todos`.

<img width="200px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/74593846-7b6b7880-4fe4-11ea-9bf8-722bf7887ef1.png" />

At any time, you can add new files to a gist or directory by right-clicking them and selecting `Add New File(s)` or `Upload File(s)`. You can also rename/delete directories as well, by right-clicking them in the tree and selecting the appropriate command. If you'd like to move a file from one directory to another, simply right-click the file, select `Rename File` and edit the directory name that it's in. It's that simple!

## Gist Commenting

Gist comments are exposed within the editor at the bottom of any opened Gist files. If a Gist includes multiple files, then the comment thread will be displayed at the bottom of them all (duplicated and synchronized).

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/70118599-42467d80-161d-11ea-85eb-7f4cc6e4006b.gif" width="700px" />

If you're not authenticated, you can view existing comments, but you can't reply to them. If you are authenticated, you can add/reply, as well as edit/delete your own comments. In order to control the behavior of how Gist comment threads are displayed, refer to the `GistPad > Comments: Show Thread` config setting.

## Pasting Images

In order to make it easy to author markdown and HTML/Pug files that include image assets, you can copy images into your clipboard (e.g. taking a screenshot, clicking `Copy Image` in your browser, etc.) and then paste them directly into a gist file by right-clicking the editor and selecting `Paste Image`, or using one of the following keyboard shortcuts: `ctrl + shift + v` _(Windows/Linux)_,`cmd + shift + v` _(macOS)_.

![paste-image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1478800/70382701-9a7ac980-1914-11ea-9fb0-6e55424e2e54.gif)

By default, when you paste an image into a Gist file, it's uploaded as a `.png` to the gist, and the appropriate reference is added to it from the document (e.g. inserting an `<img />`). However, this behavior can be changed by using the `GistPad > Images: Paste Format` and/or `GistPad > Images: Paste Type` settings. Refer to the [config settings](#configuration-settings) section below for more details.

By default, when you paste an image, it is uploaded to a directory called `images` within the gist. However, if you'd like to change this (e.g. to `assets` instead), you can set the `GistPad > Images: Directory Name` setting.

## Following Users

GitHub Gists already allows you to star other user's gists, and when you do that, those will appear in the `Gists` tree, underneath a `Starred Gists` node. However, if you want to follow a GitHub user, and easily browse all of their current and future gists (without having to star each one!), you can run the `GistPad: Follow User` command and specify their GitHub user name. Once you've done that, you'll see a new node in the `Gists` tree which displays all of their public gists, and allows you to open/fork/clone/star them just like any other gist.

<img width="252" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/69890797-c03e1800-12ef-11ea-85be-7d6fe2c8c7ef.png" />

## Exporting to Repositories

At some point, your code/notes might outgrow the feature set offered by Gists (e.g. when you want to start collaborating on the content with other developers). In that event, you can simply right-click the gist, and select the `Export to Repository` command in order to create a new GitHub repository, that contains the content of your gist. The created repo will be public or private, depending on the public/private state of the exported gist.

In order to use this command, the token you authenticate with needs to also have the `repo` scope, in addition to the `gist` scope. If it doesn't, simply generate a new token with the appropriate scopes, run the `GistPad: Sign Out` command, and then sign in again with the updated token.

### Scratch Notes

To make it easy to capture ephemeral/fleeting notes as you learn new things throughout the day, GistPad allows you to create "scratch notes" by clicking the `New scratch note...` command under the `Scratch Notes` node in the `Gists` tree (or running the `GistPad: New Scratch Note` command). A scratch note is simply a text document, whose name is formatted based on the time it was created. By default, scratch notes create Markdown documents, but you can customize that behavior (e.g. to create text/AsciiDoc/etc. files) by customizing the `GistPad > Scratch Notes: File Extension` setting.

In order to help differentiate scratch notes from your "permanent notes", scratch notes appear as children of a top-level `Scratch Notes` node in the `Gists` tree. This makes it easy to view your outstanding scratch notes, so you can periodically audit them, in order to migrate any meaningful content to a more appropriate location (e.g. a new or existing gist).

<img width="200px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/75699016-908f0b00-5c64-11ea-95d9-e8c8faf93738.png" />

You can create as many scratch notes as you need, and when you're done with them, you can delete indiviual notes and/or clear all of your notes by right-clicking the `Scratch Notes` node in the tree and selecting `Clear Scratch Notes`.

> Behind the scenes, scratch notes are simply files that are managed within a "special" secret gist on your behalf. This way, you can focus entirely on the ephemeral nature of the notes, and not worry about creating/deleting gists.

## Showcase

In order to illustrate what you can do with gists and [playgrounds](#interactive-playgrounds), as well as keep up-to-date with the cool stuff that folks in the community are building, you can check out the `Showcase` view in the `GistPad` tab. This shows a list of categories, which are meant to highlight different use cases for gists, along with some examples. Simply click the `Open` button for any gist in order to explore it, or expand the gist to see its file contents. If you have a gist that you think is worth showcasing, please open an issue and let us know about it. Otherwise, we'll keep the showcase updated periodically, to highlight new and interesting things. So stay tuned!

<img width="250px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/74891549-2c9f4500-533c-11ea-9bbb-c5907d41a589.png" />

## Playgrounds

If you're building web applications, and want to create a quick playground environment in order to experiment with HTML, CSS or JavaScript (or [Sass/SCSS, Less, Pug and TypeScript](#additional-language-support)), you can right-click the `Your Gists` node and select `New Playground` or `New Secret Playground`. This will create a new gist, seeded with an HTML, CSS and JavaScript file, and then provide you with a live preview Webview, so that you can iterate on the code and visually see how it behaves.

When you create a new playground, you'll be asked to select a template, which is simply a way to get started quickly, using the libraries and languages you intend to use (e.g. React.js, Vue.js). You can also choose not to use a template, which will simply create a new playground, with an empty HTML, CSS and JavaScript file, which you can then [add libraries](#external-libraries) to as neccessary.

![Playground](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/72381586-79a05380-36cc-11ea-824e-38f9afec136b.gif)

Since the playground is backed by a Gist, your changes are saved and shareable with your friends. Additionally, as you find other playgrounds that you'd like to use, simply fork them and create your own playgrounds. That way, you can use Gists as "templates" for playground environments, and collaborate on them with others just like you would any other gist. When you're done with a playground, simply close the preview window and all other documents will be automatically closed. If you no longer need the playground, then delete it just like any other gist 👍

### Toolbar

When you open a playground, this activates the "playground toolbar", which is a collection of helpful utilities that are displayed in the editor's title bar. The following describes the available actions:

- **Run Playground** - Re-runs the HTML, JavaScript and CSS of your playground. This can be useful when wanting to reset a playground's state and/or if you've disabled the auto-run behavior for playgrounds.
- **Open Console** - Opens the `GistPad Playground` console, which allows you to view the output of any `console.log` calls that your playground makes ([details](#console-output)).
- **Change Layout** - Allows you to change the layout configuration of the playground editors ([details](#layout)).
- **Add Library** - Allows you to add an external library to your playground (e.g. React.js, Font-Awesome) ([details](#external-libraries))
- **Open Playground Developer Tools** - Opens the Chrome Dev Tools for your playground preview, which lets you use the DOM exlporer, evaluate JavaScript expressions in the console, etc.

<img width="464" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71629353-eafee300-2bb1-11ea-88f0-0996ab6149c4.png" />

### Uploading Images

You can reference HTTP-based images within any of your playground files, and they'll be downloaded/rendered automatically. However, if you need to add local images to your playground, you can upload them in one of two ways:

1. Right-click the gist in the `Gists` view and select `Upload Files(s)`. This supports any file type, and therefore is the most general-purpose solution. Once the image is uploaded, you can then reference it from your playground using only its filename (e.g. `<img src="myImage.png" />`), since the playground preview understands the context of the "surrounding gist".

2. Copy/paste an image into your clipboard, open up an HTML or Pug file, right-click the editor and select `Paste Image`. This will transparently upload the image to the gist, and then insert a reference to it for you (e.g. adding an `<img />` tag). This solution works best when you want to paste a "transient" image into your playground, such as a captured screenshot, or an image that you copied from a webpage.

### Additional Language Support

By default, new playgrounds create an HTML, CSS and JavaScript file. However, if you're more productive using a different markup, stylesheet or scripting language, then simply rename the respective files to use the right extension, and the code will be automatically compiled for you on the fly! Specifically, GistPad supports the following languages:

- **SCSS/Sass** - Rename the `style.css` file to `style.scss` or `style.sass`. \*Note: While VS Code ships with language support for SCSS out-of-the-box, it doesn't ship support for Sass (the "indentended" syntax). So if you plan to author playgrounds with that syntax, it's recommended that you install [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Syler.sass-indented) along with GistPad.
- **Less** - Rename the `style.css` file to `style.less`
- **Markdown** - Rename the `index.html` file to `index.md`
- **Pug** - Rename the `index.html` file to `index.pug`
- **TypeScript** - Rename the `script.js` file to `script.ts` (or `script.tsx`, in order to use JSX in your code)
- **JSX** - Rename the `script.js` file to `script.jsx` in order to enable JSX to be written in "vanilla" JavaScript files. Additionally, if you add the [`react` library](#external-libraries) to your gist's `playground.json` file, then `*.js` files can also include JSX.

If you'd like to always use one of these languages, then set one or more of the following settings, and all new playgrounds will include the right files by default: `GistPad > Playgrounds: Markup Language`, `GistPad > Playgrounds: Script Language`, `GistPad > Playgrounds: Stylesheet Language`. View the [settings documentation](#configuration-settings) below for more detials.

### External Libraries

If you need to add any external JavaScript libraries (e.g. `react`) or stylesheets (e.g. `font-awesome`) to your playground, simply click the `Add Playground Library` commmand in the playground "action bar" (or run `GistPad: Add Playground Library` from the command palette). This will allow you to search for a library from CDNJS or paste a custom library URL. When you select a library, it will be automatically added to your playground.

![Add Library](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71629251-4ed4dc00-2bb1-11ea-9488-78c3d71dbacd.gif)

Behind the scenes, this command update the playground's manifest file (`playground.json`), which you can also open/edit yourself manually if you'd prefer. Additionally, since Gist files provide an internet-accessible URL, you can use Gists as re-usable snippets for playgrounds, and add references to them by right-clicking a gist file in the `Gists` tree, select `Copy GitHub URL`, and then adding it as a library reference to the appropriate playground.

### Layout

By default, when you create a playground, it will open in a "Split Left" layout, which vertically stacks the code editors on the left, and allows the preview window to occupy the fully IDE height on the right. However, if you want to change the layout, you can run the `GistPad: Change Playout Layout` command and select `Grid`, `Preview`, `Split Bottom`, `Split Right`, or `Split Top`.

![Layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71560396-5152fc80-2a1e-11ea-9cff-a9590e1ea779.gif)

Additionally, if you create a playground, that looks best in a specific layout, you can set the `layout` property in the playground's `playground.json` file to either: `grid`, `preview`, `splitLeft`, `splitLeftTabbed`, `splitRight`, `splitRightTabbed` or `splitTop`. Then, when you or someone else opens this playground, it will be opened with the specified layout, as opposed to the user's configured default layout.

### Console Output

The playground also provides an output window in order to view any logs written via the `console.log` API. You can bring up the output window, as well as run the playground or open the Chrome Developer Tools, by clicking the respective command icon in the editor toolbar. If you'd like to always open the console when creating/opening playgrounds, you can set the `GistPad > Playgrounds: Show Console` setting to `true`.

<img width="503" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71384593-0a38b780-2597-11ea-8bba-73f784f6ec76.png" />

Additionally, if you create a playground that depends on the console, you can set the `showConsole` property in the playground's `playground.json` file to `true`. Then, when you or someone else opens this playground, the console will be automatically opened, regardless whether the end-user has configured it to show by default.

### Readme

If you'd like to give your playground an introduction, you can create a file in the playground called `README.md` (or `README.markdown`), and by default, it's contents will be rendered above the playground code in the preview window. When a playground is opened, the `README.md` file isn't opened, which allows the playground to be focused on the core code assets (e.g. `index.html`, `script.js`), and allow the preview window to include embedded documentation.

Your playground can customize how the readme is rendered by setting the `readmeBehavior` property in your `playground.json` file to either `previewFooter` (which renders the content beneath the preview content), `inputComment` (which renders the content beneath an [input file](#playground-input)), or `none` (which doesn't render the contents at all).

### Modules

By default, playground's assume you're using "standard" JavaScript code (`<script type="text/javascript" />`), and allows you to add 3rd-party [libraries](#external-libraries), which are added via new `<script>` elements in the preview page. However, if you'd like to write JavaScript code using `import`/`export`, you can set the `scriptType` property to `module` in the playground's `playground.json` file, and then begin to `import` modules. To simplify the process of importing 3rd-party modules, we'd recommend using either [Unkpkg](https://unpkg.com) (adding the [`?module` parameter](https://unpkg.com/#query-params) to any URLs), or the [Pika CDN](https://www.pika.dev/cdn).

### Temporary Playgrounds

If you'd like to create a playground, without persisting it as a gist, you can create a "temporary playground" by selecting the `Don't create gist` button on the playground creation form (as opposed to giving it a description). You'll be able to edit, add, delete, and rename files just like a normal gist, but the changes are only kept in memory, and therefore, represent a great solution for exploring ideas quickly, and then moving on.

<img width="600px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/74090056-40a19780-4a5c-11ea-896b-dfbb03e7f7d6.png" />

Note that temporary gists don't appear in the main `Gists` explorer tree, and therefore, to manage files within a temporary gist, you need to use the `Active Gist` tree on the `GistPad` tab.

### Gist Links

If you'd like to add a link in your gist/readme, which references a file and/or line/column within a file in the gist, simply add a hyperlink, whose `href` value uses the `gist:` scheme (kind of like a `mailto:`), and specifies the file name you'd like to open (e.g. `gist:index.html`). Optionally, you can specify a line and column number as well (e.g. `gist:index.html@23:5`), which allows you to highlight a specific line/span of code when the end-user clicks on it.

#### Playground Config

If you need to customize the appearance/behavior of a playground and/or each step within your tutorial, you can create a `config.json` file with your playground to indicate the playground's configuration settings. This file will be automatically loaded/parsed, and exposed to your code via the `widow.config` global variable. This makes it really easy to customize your playground, without needing to write the code to load the step config manually.

#### Playground Input

If your playground needs to accept user input (e.g. to allow a user to take a challenge, play a game), then you can set the `input` property of your `playground.json` file to an object that includes two properties:

- `fileName` - Indicates the "file name" of the virtual input file that will be created and displayed to the end-user. Note that this is mostly valuable for two reasons: setting the context to the end-user of what input the file expects (e.g. `CSS Selector`), and triggering colorization/language support by setting a file extension.

- `prompt` - Indicates an optional prompt (e.g. `Specify the name of the CSS selector`) that is rendered to the right of the input.

As the user types into the input file, the playground will look for a global function called `checkInput`, and if present, it will call that function, passing it the current value of the input file. This function should return a `boolean` which indicates whether or not the user completed the challenge.

Once completed, a modal dialog will appear, indicating to the user that they finished the challenge, and asking if they want to continue or exit the playground. If you'd like to customize the message that appears upon completion, simply set the `input.completionMessage` property to the desired string.

> Note: If you want to provide additionally help information for your input, you can create a `README.md` file in your playground/tutorial and set the `readmeBehavior` property in your `playground.json` manifest to `inputComment`. This will render the contents of the readme as a inline code comment, directly beneath the input file.

#### Custom Playground Canvas

If your playground requires a custom/interactive experience, but you don't want to place that HTML/JavaScript/CSS code in the `index.html` file (because it would open up for your end-users to see it), you can define a `canvas.html` file in your playground, which will be used as the main markup content for the playground.

For example, you could create a playground with a `canvas.html` file that contains your playground's HTML content, and a `style.css` file that's intended to include user-entered CSS. Because you define the HTML via `canvas.html` instead of `index.html`, then the HTML file wouldn't automatically open up, and therefore, the user could focus entirely on the CSS.

### Tutorials

By default, a playground represents a single interactive sample. However, they can also represent multi-step tutorials/presentations, by making two simple changes:

1. Specifying a tutorial title, by setting the `tutorial` property in the playground's `playground.json` file

1. Defining a series of steps as gist [directories](#files-and-directories), whose name starts with the step number and includes an optional description (e.g. `1`, `1 - Discussion of text`, `#1 - Intro`). The contents of the directory match that of a standard playground (e.g. an `index.html`, `script.js` file, etc.), and it's encouraged that each step have a [readme](#readme) that includes instructions. The number of steps in the tutorial is determined by the number of directories in the gist that follow the aforementioned pattern.

When a user opens up a tutorial playground, they'll only see the contents of the current step, and the preview window will include a navigation header that allows moving forward and backwards in the tutorial. Additionally, the user's current step will be persisted so that they can take a tutorial and pick up where they left off when they re-open the tutorial. To try an example, view the [Learning MobX Tutorial](https://gist.github.com/lostintangent/c3bcd4bff4a13b2e1b3fc4a26332e2b6).

![MobX](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/74594741-8d521900-4fee-11ea-97ac-1fdfac132724.gif)

### CodeTour

GistPad includes integration with [CodeTour](https://aka.ms/codetour), which allows you to author interactive walkthroughs of a codebase. This can be helpful for annotating relevant "markers" within a playground, and encouraging users/yourself where to focus. In order to create a code tour for a playground, simply open the playground, and click the `...` menu in the editor window of any of the playground's document or the preview window. Select `Record CodeTour` and then start adding step annotations to your playground's code. Then, anytime you or someone else opens your playground, the tour will be automatically started.

> For more information on CodeTour, and how to navigate/author tours, refer to the [CodeTour](https://aka.ms/codetour) documentation.

### Template Galleries

When you create a new playground, you'll see a list of templates, which let you create playgrounds using a pre-defined set of files and external libraries (e.g. React.js, Vue). This makes it really easy to get started quickly, and reduce repetitive tasks/boilerplate. By default, GistPad includes a standard set of templates, which come from two built-in galleries: `web:languages` and `web:libraries`. If you don't intend to use one or both of these, you can disable them by clicking the gear icon when running the `New Playground` (or `New Secret Playground`) command, and de-selecting the galleries you don't want. Additionally, you can modify the `GistPad > Playgrounds: Template Galleries` setting.

Behind the scenes, a template gallery is simply a JSON file, which is hosted somewhere (e.g. a gist, a git repo, your own web server), and defines a set of templates. A template is simply a gist, which includes the neccessary files (e.g. HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.), and then defines a name and description. To see an example of how to define a template gallery, see the built-in [`web:libraries` gallery](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lostintangent/ece303a6b8c7cbf0293b850b600e3cb6/raw/gallery.jsonn). Additionally, to see an example of a template, see the [React.js template](https://gist.github.com/lostintangent/f15a2e498523f364e36075691542af4c).

When defining the template, you can use the `playground.json` file to indicate not only the JavaScript and CSS libraries that the playgroud needs, but also, the [layout](#layout) it should use by default, and whether or not the console should be automatically opened (e.g. because the playground relies on writing console logs). See [the docs](#playground-metadata) for more details on this file.

### User Templates

In addition to using/creating template galleries, you can also mark your own local playgrounds gists as being templates, by simply setting `"template": true` in the playground's `playground.json` file. Then, when you create a new playground, you'll see your template in the list. This option is good for defining your own templates, that you don't intend to share with others.

Additionally, if you star a gist that is marked as a playground template, that will show up in the list of templates as well. That way, you can easily share templates with others, without needing to create a template gallery.

### Playground Metadata

Whenever you create a playground, it includes a `playground.json` file, which defines the metadata for the playground, including it's behavior, requirements and intended presentation.

- `scripts` - An array of URLs that indicate the JavaScript libraries which should be added to the playground when run. This property can be managed via the `Add Library` command in the [playground toolbar](#toolbar), and therefore, it isn't neccesary to manually edit it. Defaults to `[]`.

- `styles` - An array of URLs that indicate the CSS libraries which should be added to the playground when run. This property can be managed via the `Add Library` command in the [playground toolbar](#toolbar), and therefore, it isn't neccesary to manually edit it. Defaults to `[]`.

- `showConsole` - Specifies whether to automatically open the [console](#console-output) when someone opens this playground. Note that this will take precendence over the user's configure console setting, and therefore, is useful when a playground relies on console output, and can ensure the playground is setup correctly without requiring the end-user to explicitly open the console.

- `layout` - Specifies the [layout](#layout) to use when someone opens this playground. Note that this will take precedence over the user's configured default layout, and therefore, is useful when a playground is optimized for a specific layout, and therefore, can ensure the end-user has the best experience by default.

- `scriptType` - Indicates the value of `<script>` element's `type` attribute, when injected into the playground preview page. Can either be `text/javascript` or `module`. Defaults to `text/javascript`.

- `template` - Indicates that this playground is intended to be used as a [template for new playgrounds](#user-templates), and therefore, will appear in the list when creating a new playground. Defaults to `false`.

- `readmeBehavior` - Indicates how the playground's [readme](#readme) (if it has one) will be rendered to the end-user. Defaults to `previewHeader`.
-
- `tutorial` - Indicates that this playground is intended to be used as a [multi-step tutorial](#tutorials). When set, this property indicates the title of the tutorial.

- `input` - Indicates that this playground requires [user input](#playground-input), and also specifies an optional input file name, prompt message and completion message.

### CodePen

If you export a pen to a [GitHub Gist](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/exporting-pens/#save-as-github-gist-2), and then refresh the `Gists` tree in VS Code, you'll be able to see the pen and then can open/edit it like any other playground. This allows you to easily fork someone's pen and work on it within VS Code.

![CodePen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71393589-171ed080-25c2-11ea-8138-ba075daf7d37.gif)

Additionally, if you develop a playground locally, and want to export it to CodePen (e.g. in order to share it with the community), you can right-click the gist and select `Export to CodePen`. This allows you to develop within VS Code, and then share it when you're done. When a playground is exported to CodePen, it's tagged with `gistpad` so that the community can [see](https://aka.ms/gistpad-codepen) the pens being created with it.

![Export](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71533903-39f60100-28b0-11ea-9e16-891a110c7074.gif)

### Blocks

[Bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org) is community for sharing interactive code samples/data visualizations, which are based on GitHub Gists. As a result, you can copy the URL for any Block, use it to open a gist within GistPad, and immediately have an interactive environment for viewing/exploring the Block.

Additionally, you can create new blocks with GistPad by adding the optional `Blocks` gallery, and then creating a new playground using one of the block templates. From there you can edit HTML, use the included D3 library, upload data files (e.g. JSON, CSV, TSV) and watch the preview update in real-time. If you'd like to view/share the playground, you can right-click the gist and select `View Gist in Bl.ocks`.

![blocks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/73127896-28217f80-3f7c-11ea-99a6-e7ab0be0aabf.gif)

## GistLog

In addition to being able to use Gists to share code snippets/files, you can also use it as a mini-blog, thanks to integration with [GistLog](https://gistlog.co). In order to start blogging, simply run the `GistPad: New GistLog` command, which will create a new Gist that includes two files: `blog.md` and `gistlog.yml`.

![GistLog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/70856110-fdc3a900-1e8a-11ea-8e26-2c3917e11db0.gif)

The `blog.md` file will be automatically opened for editing, and as soon as you're ready to publish your post, open `gistlog.yml` and set the `published` property to `true`. Then, right-click your Gist and select the `Open Gist in GistLog` menu. This will open your browser to the URL that you can share with others, in order to read your new post.

In addition to being able to view individual posts on GistLog, you can also open your entire feed by right-clicking the `Your Gists` tree node and selecting the `Open Feed in GistLog` menu item. This will launch your GistLog landing page that displays are published GistLog posts.

## Contributed Commands (File Explorer)

In addition to the `Gists` view, GistPad also contributes an `Copy File to Gist` command to the context menu of the `Explorer` file tree, which allows you to easily add local files to a new or existing Gist.

<img width="260px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/69831695-58001100-11df-11ea-997e-fc8020556348.png" />

## Contributed Commands (Editor)

In addition to the `Explorer` file tree commands, GistPad also contributes the following commands to the editor's context menu:

- `Add Selection to Gist` - Allows you to add a snippet/selection of code to a Gist, instead of the entire document

- `Paste Gist File` - Allows you to paste the contents of a Gist file into the active document

- `Paste Image` - Allows you to paste an image from your clipboard into a markdown, HTML or Pug file. The command will automatically upload the image and then add a reference to it.

<img width="250px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/69903980-98819b00-1355-11ea-913b-c51981891bcd.png" />

The `Copy File to Gist` command is also available on the editor tab's context menu.

## Contributed Commands (Editor Title Bar)

In addition to the commands added to the editor context menu, GistPad also contributes the following commands to the editor's title bar menu (click the `...` in the upper right section of an editor window):

- `Rename File` - Allows you to rename the current file.

## Contributed Commands (Command Palette)

## Extensibility

In order to allow other extensions to extend the default behavior and/or settings of GistPad, the following extensibility points are provided:

### Template Galleries

By default, GistPad ships with a new of template galleries, however, extensions can contribute new ones by adding a `gistpad.playgrounds.templateGalleries` contribution to their `package.json` file. This contribution is simply an array of objects with the following properties:

- `id` - A unique ID that will be used to persist the enabled/disabled state of the gallery. Note that the display name of the gallery comes from the gallery definition itself.
- `url` - A URL that points at the actual template gallery. This URL must refer to a JSON file that conforms to the [GistPad template gallery schema](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lostintangent/091c0eec1f6443b526566d1cd3a85294/raw/3c1413b49052a677b1f5d192c5c37d6b2c2b9fae/schema.json).

## Supported Filesystem Operations

Once you've opened a Gist, you can perform the following filesystem operations:

- Editing existing files
- Adding new files
- Renaming files
- Deleting files
- Copying/pasting files

> GitHub Gist doesn't support directories, and therefore, this extension doesn't allow you to create them.

## Recommended Extensions

In order to improve the productivity of editing Gists, and make VS Code behave similarly to the GitHub.com experience, the following extensions are recommended, depending on how you expect to use Gists (e.g. markdown files, code snippets):

| Extension           | Stats                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
